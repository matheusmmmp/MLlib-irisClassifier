## ✎About

This notebook is a form to practice my knowledge in data science, mostly with the **MLlib library in PySpark**. It walks us through a workflow for solving a problem with a classify iris especies algorithm.

The decision tree is one of the oldest and most widely used methods in machine learning, and it can be used to classify an element by analyzing the relationships between its variables. These algorithms progressively subdivide the data into smaller and more specific sets, in terms of their attributes, until they reach a size simplified enough to be labeled. To do so, it is necessary to train the model with previously labeled data in order to apply it to new data.

The main purpose of this notebook is to serve as a step-by-step workflow guide, allowing me to review this notebook myself and serve as a study for future cases.

This notebook was developed within the databricks environment [DataBricks](https://www.databricks.com/).
